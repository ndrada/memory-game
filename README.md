# memory-game
Vanilla JS memory game

16 squares (initially with no background color)


The game allows you to click 2 squares, then, if the colors revealed are a match, the score increases by 1.


If the colors are not a match, the colors of the squares get reset to no background and you get to click again. 


At the end, a "Play Again" button shows up that reloads the screen and allows you to restart the game.


No special packages required to run the program.
